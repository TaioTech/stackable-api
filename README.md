# stackable-api
Full stack application to be launched on Google App Engine for business API advantages consisting of a Phoenix backend framework written in Elixir along with an EmberJS written frontend.

To take advantage of this source code, you will have to have quite a broad spectrum of knowledge in coding as my commits will be rather bland. Each directory from within the root will lead you in the right direction in terms of the accurate README.md file to proceed on.
Enjoy.
